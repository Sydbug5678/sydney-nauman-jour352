 <h2>Experience:</h2>
    <h3>Producer</h3>  
    <h4>WMUC Radio News Weekly Roundup</h4>
    <h5>Spring 2023-Present</h5>
    <p>Managed a group of eight to ten journalists to create a 30-minute radio news show on a weekly basis. In this role I have expanded WMUC's audience interaction and listenership by increasing our social media presence and introducing new segments on the show, like the investigative segment “A Deeper Dive.” In this segment reporters investigate problems affecting the surrounding community, including those brought up by students. </p>
    <h3>Studio Production</h3>
    <h4>Capital News Service-College Park Bureau</h4>
    <h5>Spring 2023</h5>
    <p>Worked as the technical director, floor director, camerawoman, and graphics producer for Capital News Service's broadcast twice a week. Through this experience I learned the elements of producing a television newscast while receiving hands-on training in multiple different studio production jobs including audio, floor directing, working cameras, and directing before settling into my regular jobs of graphics producer and technical director.</p>
    <h3>Freelance Writer</h3>
    <h4>Southern Maryland News</h4>
    <h5>Spring 2023</h5>
    <p>Worked as a reporter for a local newspaper, released weekly, in both print and digital formats. In this role I gained professional experience in print journalism as well as working in the local journalism field.</p>
    <h3>Anchor & Reporter</h3>
    <h4>WMUC Radio News' Weekly Roundup</h4>
    <h5>Fall 2022</h5>
    <p>Produced and broadcasted local news stories for the University of Maryland's radio station. In these roles I learned how to write and prepare copy for a broadcast platform and produce story packages and gained experience with radio reporting.</p>
    <h3>Freelance Writer</h3>
    <h4>Stories Beneath the Shell</h4>
    <h5>Fall 2022</h5> 
    <p>Produced news stories for the online, student-run publication, Stories Beneath the Shell. In this role I gained experience picking up and pitching story ideas to the general assignment editors and taking photographs to accompany the copy.</p>
    <h3>Editor in Chief</h3> 
    <h4>Northern High School's Patriot Press</h4>
    <h5>2019-2020</h5>
