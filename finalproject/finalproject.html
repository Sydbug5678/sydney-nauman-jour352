        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Wildfires across the United States and Canada — fueled by record heat and dry conditions — could severely impact the health of millions of people. Smoke from wildfires in several Canadian provinces, including Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, led to air quality alerts throughout several 
            states in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Additionally, fires in Michigan and New Jersey have created dense fog and heavy smoke.</p>

            <p>About 102 million people live in areas were expected to reach at least a code orange level of air quality Wednesday, which is unhealthy for sensitive groups, the Environmental Protection Agency said.</p>

            <p>Chicagoans awoke to a clouded, gray sky, limiting visibility, irritating lungs and filling noses with a thick burning smell for the second straight day Wednesday. The sky was smoky in Milwaukee, Indianapolis and several other metropolises. In Detroit, smoke combined with a dense fog to limit visibility to below a quarter-mile early Wednesday, forcing drivers to take extra caution.</p>
            
            <p>Populations on the East Coast also were under air quality alerts Wednesday, including the Washington, D.C., area. The quality was expected to worsen and spread up and down the coast, infiltrating the New York City region and as far south as the Carolinas into Thursday.</p>
    
            <p>Particulate levels set record highs Tuesday for the past two decades in Buffalo, New York; Cincinnati; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Madison, Wisconsin; 
            and Milwaukee, the Weather Channel reported.</p>
    
            <p>“You can smell it bad,” said Priti Marwah, who was beginning a run along Chicago’s lakefront. “I run a hundred miles a week, so this is going to be 
            dangerous today. You can feel it. … Just even parking right there and coming out, I can feel it in my lungs.”</p>

<p>“Wildfire smoke itself is quite a complex mixture and it’s made up of fine particles … and a number of other gases, which are toxic, mainly due to the 
fact that wildfires burn everything so more toxic than household fires because everything has been burned,” Dr. Kimberly Humphrey, a climate change 
and human health fellow at the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told ABC News.</p>

<p>Fine particulate matter known as PM2.5, which is 30 times smaller in diameter than a human hair, is of particular concern.</p>

    <p>Not all PM2.5 particles are the same. One study from California in 2021 found that 
    those from wildfires can be up to 10 times more harmful than the same type of air 
    pollution coming from combustion activity.</p>

    <p>Being exposed to smoke can cause lung inflammation and could make it harder 
    to remove inhaled foreign materials and bacteria, potentially increasing the 
    susceptibility to respiratory infections, including COVID-19, according to the 
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

    <p>Depending upon the length and amount of exposure, prolonged lung inflammation
    could result in impaired lung function that lasts long after the wildfire has ended.</p>

    <p>Additionally, studies have shown a link between poor air quality — which these 
    fires have caused — and cardiovascular disease, including strokes, heart attacks, 
    heart failure and atrial fibrillation.</p>

    <p>Because of climate change, there will not only be more record-setting wildfires 
    but also more people at risk of inhaling toxic smoke as well, the experts said.</p>

    <p>“It’s clear that the climate change problem is essentially creating conditions 
    that make the fire problem and the smoke problem worse,” Limaye said. 
    “So, we’re talking about, hotter days, longer wildfire, seasons, drier conditions, 
    spring snowmelt that essentially, put more wildfire fuel in play earlier — 
    all these kinds of converging factors.”</p>

    <p>He added, “And I think it’s reasonable to expect that wildfire smoke is going to 
    grow as a public health concern in the coming years.”</p>

    <p>Humphrey recommends that people stay aware of their local air quality and, if it reaches unhealthy levels, to wear a mask, ideally an N95.</p>

    <p>There were 483 active wildfires throughout Canada as of Tuesday, 
      according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Of those, 
      253 were considered out of control. Nearly a quarter of the fires 
      burning in Canada were in Quebec.</p> 
      
      
      <p>This year has seen a record-breaking fire season for Canada, and it’s 
      still early. More than 29,393 square miles have burned this year, exceeding
      the record set in 1989 of 29,187 square miles, according to the National 
      Forestry Database.

          heart and lung problems should take greater care to avoid strenuous 
          activity outdoors or stay inside as much as they can. When the air quality 
          reaches an unhealthy level for everyone, it’s best for all to stay indoors.</p>
          
          <p id="stroke">The small particles in wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat 
          and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe.</p>
          
          <p id="stroke">Keep windows and doors shut to prevent smoky air from getting inside, and 
          use air purifiers to improve indoor air quality. If you must go outside, make it 
          brief and wear an N95 or better mask, experts say.</p>
